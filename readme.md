## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flip card animations
- Native javascript resources

### What I learned

In this project I challenged myself to use only CSS transitions to all the animations visible on screen. Beyond that, I was able to reinforce and improve some concepts of JS, like array manipulations (.map / .sort). I definitely will do similar game projects like this in the future, there is a lot of knowledge and skills to put together to get a good final result.
